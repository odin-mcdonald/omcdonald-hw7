BAIS-3300 HW 7 Web Forms

This is a survey inquiring about some music preferences in metal and hip-hop/rap.

My survey web form follows best practices by including a minimum of 3 questions per page. Placeholders and autofocus are utilized and all questions are used with the correct input types. 
Each page had a submission button and properly linked to the next page. All headings are properly nested and questions spaced out with labels used throughout.
